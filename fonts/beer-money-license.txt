BEER MONEY is a hand drawn (scribble) font with language extentions and some 
funny features

Latin1
Latin2 Eastern European
Cyrillic
Turkish
Windows Baltic

and correction signs , try it!  :
 
<  crosses out the word written before it
 <<   longer cross out
  <<<  even longer cross out
>scribble
>>pipe
typeing „nummer” makes the No. sign

This font is free for personal and commercial use , but you can make a SMALL DONATION if you think it’s worth a BEER! I would respact that a lot!

I would also appreciate feedbacks or kerning help mostly in case of cyrillic issues may occure. 

I hope you enjoy this font!

Cheers! 
Roland
